As described in more detail in Treasury’s <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ORP-Learning-Agenda-Final.pdf\">Economic Recovery Learning Agenda</a>, in the immediate term, a key research priority is understanding the impacts of SLFRF award funds in priority policy areas. </p><p >In particular, Treasury has identified a small set of priority areas where SLFRF funds can have the most transformative long-term impact on communities, including projects that are focused on affordable housing, workforce, and public safety.

Examining the short-term and long-term impact on households, organizations, communities, and governments from specific SLFRF projects in priority policy areas such as affordable housing, workforce, and public safety, could include research that answers more detailed questions such as: </p><ul ><li><p>How have SLFRF-funded community violence interventions—such as violence interrupter programs, 911 mental health response units, and youth employment programs—improved public safety and health in communities?</p></li><li><p>To what extent have workforce development projects helped disproportionally impacted individuals improve their employment opportunities and earnings?</p></li><li><p>What innovative approaches to housing stability have jurisdictions employed to meet the housing challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and increase long-term housing stability?</p></li><li><p>To what extent have recipients used SLFRF resources to complement and increase the impact of funds from other Treasury housing programs such as the Emergency Rental Assistance program and the Homeowner Assistance Fund? </p></li></ul>"},{"fieldTitle":"Deliverables","fieldData":"<ul ><li><p><strong>Meetings:</strong> Regular meetings with Treasury program and evaluation staff to discuss the research approach, the evaluation plan, initial findings, and reports</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluation Plan:</strong> An evaluation plan that Treasury will review before researchers begin any analysis.
