NIH conducts and supports biomedical, behavioral, and social science research across a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and approaches in pursuit of its mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to use that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. NIH research focuses on both ongoing and emerging public health needs. As NIH identifies these needs, it uses different scientific approaches to understand the basic causes and mechanisms of disease, find new ways of identifying, preventing, and curing disease processes, and bring these new interventions into common practice for the public’s benefit.</p><p >NIH is seeking to engage with the scientific community to study NIH processes and programs to further strengthen the evidence base that supports NIH decision-making.  The proposed research efforts focus on strengthening the agency’s evidence-building capabilities in order to improve the public’s and NIH’s own understanding of its impacts.
