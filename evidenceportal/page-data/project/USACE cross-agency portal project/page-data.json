The increasing frequency and severity of natural and human-made disasters require a consistent and evidence-based approach to measuring resilience. Current methods of resilience quantification are fragmented across agencies, creating challenges in coordinating responses and evaluating the effectiveness of resilience-building initiatives.</p><p>Harmonizing existing resilience metrics and methodologies is intended to allow for coherent assessment and comparison across different agencies and domains, including infrastructure, social systems, and ecosystems. By standardizing these metrics, the project will enhance the ability of federal agencies to collaboratively address complex, multidimensional threats, improving both the effectiveness and efficiency of disaster response and resilience-building efforts.</p><p>The selected project team will convene and facilitate a workshop of leading scientists, engineers, and policymakers with expertise in measuring resilience across a variety of settings. This workshop will identify gaps in current resilience measurement practices and develop a unified framework for resilience quantification. Informed by the workshop, the project team will compile a comprehensive report, outlining actionable recommendations for implementing standardized resilience metrics across federal agencies. The resulting standardized framework will provide federal agencies with the tools needed to build a shared evidence base to support informed decisions and improve resilience in the face of evolving threats.</p><p>This initiative aligns with key policy priorities, such as climate adaptation, disaster preparedness, and national security, and supports the national resilience strategy (e.g., FEMA National Resilience Guidance: A Collaborative Approach to Building Resilience).</p><p></p>"},{"fieldTitle":"Deliverables","fieldData":"<ul ><li><p>Workshop on resilience metrics standardization: A multi-agency event with external researchers and experts to identify and address gaps in resilience measurement and harmonization efforts across federal agencies.</p></li><li><p>Comprehensive report with actionable recommendations: A detailed report providing standardized resilience metrics, methodologies, and evidence-based recommendations for cross-agency implementation.</p></li><li><p>Standardized resilience framework: A unified framework for consistent assessment and comparison of resilience metrics across federal agencies, supporting improved disaster preparedness and response.</p></li></ul>"},{"fieldTitle":"Planned use of results","fieldData":"<p >Results from this project will support informed decision-making and coordinated action across federal agencies by developing a standardized resilience quantification framework, enabling agencies to assess, strengthen, and prioritize resilience measures effectively in response to national or local challenges.
