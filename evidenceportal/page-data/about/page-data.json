To help Federal agencies meet their ambitious <a href='https://www.evaluation.gov/evidence-plans/learning-agenda/'>plans</a>  for building and using evidence, Evaluation.gov is piloting the Evidence Project Portal to raise awareness of Federal agency evidence needs and provide external researchers and members of the public with a way to learn more about and express interest in collaborating with agencies on these projects. With permission, OMB adapted the materials and processes on this site from the <a target='_blank' href='https://projectportal.nc.gov'>North Carolina Office of Strategic Partnerships</a> and The Policy Lab at UNC-Chapel Hill."},{"title":"Promote strong research collaboration at all stages of the agency's learning process","text":"Federal agencies are seeking research partners from a wide range of disciplines, reflecting the fact that evidence-building needs are varied, as are the backgrounds and expertise best suited to address those needs. Where possible, project summaries include information about what types of expertise are likely needed; but if you have an idea for how to contribute that is different or not stated in the summary, please reach out."},{"title":"Share knowledge about what works","text":"Each announcement invites researchers to express their interest in working on a project. Agency project leads will hold a researcher interest meeting, inviting all those who expressed interest in the project. That meeting provides an opportunity to learn more about the evidence needs, ask questions, and explore the potential for collaborating with the agency. Projects that are scalable, sustainable, and that develop public, open-source resources will be prioritized."}],"faq":[{"title":"What does the Evidence Project Portal offer?","text":"The Portal offers researchers opportunities to connect directly with staff at Federal government agencies who are looking for experts to help provide critical evidence to inform their agencies’ decision making.<br><br>Through the Portal, researchers can:<ul><li>Learn about specific evidence needs that Federal agencies are seeking help to address;</li><li>Bring their expertise and skills to bear on issues and programs for which Federal agency staff need more and better evidence; and</li><li>Build ongoing collaborative relationships with Federal agencies.</li></ul><br>The Portal is informed by other successful portals operating at the State and local level. You can explore examples at <a target='_blank' href='https://projectportal.nc.gov'>North Carolina</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://researchpartnerships.sanantonio.gov/'>San Antonio</a>."},{"title":"Who can find opportunities through the Evidence Project Portal?","text":"The Portal is public, allowing anyone to view and search. Individuals with relevant expertise, including researchers in academia or other organizations, are invited to respond to opportunities on the Portal. The transparent nature of the Portal is intended to broaden the reach of Federal agencies among the external research community.<br><br>The technical skills and desired expertise vary by the specific projects. Researchers from varied backgrounds and different levels of experience are encouraged to review project opportunities."},{"title":"What should I do if I am interested in an open project?","text":"If you are interested in an open project, click on the link provided on the Portal to RSVP to the corresponding researcher interest meeting. The researcher interest meetings are virtual, open conversations where the lead agency staff provide background on the Portal project and answer questions. When researcher interest meetings are recorded, the video is shared on the project’s page in the Portal.<br><br>During the interest meeting, agency staff will explain the next steps for those interested in working on the project. For example, they may ask that you follow up with your resume or CV and a brief description of how you would approach the project. If agency staff think that a researcher is a good fit, they will follow up to explore how to formalize an agreement and launch the project."},{"title":"Is there funding available?","text":"Funding availability depends on the specific project and host agency. Projects will specify whether and what funding is available. Some projects have dedicated funding, while others may not have funding available at this time."},{"title":"What kind of data could be available?","text":"Data availability depends on the specific project. Academic collaborators will need to sign a Data Use Agreement if the project requires access to data that is not publicly available, following all procedures required by the Federal agency partner."},{"title":"Do I need to have prior experience working with the Federal Government?","text":"No! Broadening connections between Federal agencies and researchers is an overarching goal of the Evidence Project Portal. The Portal aims to reduce barriers that researchers outside Federal government face in understanding what evidence agencies need by making it easier to connect and collaborate with agency staff and subject matter experts."},{"title":"Can graduate students participate?","text":"Yes, although the experience and expertise needed for each project varies based on the requirements of the sponsoring agency. These requirements will be specified on the Portal. Graduate students are always welcome to express interest."}],"accessibility":"","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#98b8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/1bd7f/background.jpg","srcSet":"/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/4e6b6/background.jpg 391w,\n/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/6d1d0/background.jpg 782w,\n/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/1bd7f/background.jpg 1563w,\n/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/86354/background.jpg 3126w","sizes":"(min-width: 1563px) 1563px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/c38aa/background.webp 391w,\n/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/e9001/background.webp 782w,\n/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/41f30/background.webp 1563w,\n/preview/gsa/eoc/feature/OMB-3-Release2.0-Demo/evidenceportal/static/e380fe76e496dd3f22981d6e21d7dcc2/f2985/background.webp 3126w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1563px) 1563px, 100vw"}]},"width":1563,"height":364}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"about"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677476431"],"slicesMap":{}}
