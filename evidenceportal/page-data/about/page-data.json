To help Federal agencies meet their ambitious <a target='_blank' href='https://www.evaluation.gov/evidence-plans/learning-agenda/'>plans</a> for building and using evidence, Evaluation.gov is piloting the Evidence Project Portal to raise awareness of Federal agency evidence needs and provide external researchers and members of the public with a way to express interest in partnering on these projects. The OMB Evidence Team is using materials and processes developed by the <a target='_blank' href='https://projectportal.nc.gov'>North Carolina Office of Strategic Partnerships</a> as a basis for the research partnerships and associated efforts of the Evidence Project Portal."},{"title":"Promote strong partnerships at all stages of the learning process","text":"Agencies are seeking partners from a wide range of disciplines, reflecting the fact that evidence-building needs are varied, as are the backgrounds and expertise best suited to address those needs. Where possible, project summaries include information about what types of expertise are likely needed; but if you have an idea for how to contribute that is different or not stated in the summary, please reach out."},{"title":"Share knowledge about what works","text":"Each project invites researchers to express their interest in working on a project. Agency project leads will hold a researcher interest meeting, inviting all those who expressed interest in the project. That meeting provides an opportunity to learn more about the evidence needs, ask questions, and explore the potential for partnering. Projects that are scalable, sustainable, and develop public, open-source resources will be prioritized."}],"faq":[{"title":"What does the Evidence Project Portal offer?","text":"The portal offers researchers opportunities to connect directly with staff at Federal government agencies looking for experts who can help provide critical evidence to inform their agencies’ decision making.<br><br>Through the Portal, researchers can:<ul><li>Learn about specific evidence needs that Federal agencies are seeking help to address,</li><li>Bring their expertise and skills to bear on issues and programs for which Federal agency staff need more and better evidence, and</li><li>Build ongoing collaborative relationships with Federal agencies.</li></ul><br>The Portal is informed by successful portals operating at the State and local level. You can explore examples at <a href='https://projectportal.nc.gov'>North Carolina</a> and <a href='https://researchpartnerships.sanantonio.gov/'>San Antonio</a>."},{"title":"Who can find opportunities through the Evidence Project Portal?","text":"The Portal is public allowing anyone to view and search. Individuals with relevant expertise, including researchers in academia or other organizations, are invited to respond to opportunities on the Portal. The transparent nature of the Portal is intended to broaden the reach of Federal agencies among the external research community.<br><br>The technical skills and desired expertise vary by the specific projects. Researchers from varied backgrounds and different levels of experience are encouraged to review project opportunities."},{"title":"What should I do if I am interested in an open opportunity?","text":"If you are interested in a project opportunity, click on the link provided on the Portal to RSVP to the corresponding researcher interest meeting. The researcher interest meetings are virtual, open conversations where the lead agency staff provide background on the portal project and answer questions. Most researcher interest meetings are recorded and the video is shared on the project’s page in the Portal.<br><br>During the interest meeting, agency staff will explain the next steps for those interested in working on the project. For example, they may ask that you follow up with your resume or CV and a brief description of how you would approach the project. If agency staff think that a researcher is a good fit, they will follow up to explore how to formalize an agreement and launch the project."},{"title":"Is there funding available?","text":"Funding availability depends on the specific project and host agency. Projects will specify whether and what funding is available. Some projects have dedicated funding, others may not have funding available at this time. Agencies may also be able to offer other benefits such as opportunities to engage with Federal officials and/or access to relevant data."},{"title":"What kind of data could be available?","text":"Data availability depends on the specific project. Academic collaborators will need to sign a Data Use Agreement if the project requires access to data that is not publicly available, following all procedures required by the Federal agency partner."},{"title":"Do I need to have prior experience working with the Federal Government?","text":"No! Broadening connections between Federal agencies and researchers is an overarching goal of the Evidence Project Portal. The Portal aims to reduce the barriers that researchers outside the Federal government face to understanding what evidence Federal agencies need and to connecting with agencies officials who are in a position to apply the evidence and insights that external researchers produce."},{"title":"Can graduate students participate?","text":"Yes, though the experience and expertise needed for each project varies based on the requirements of the sponsoring agency. These will be specified on the Portal.
