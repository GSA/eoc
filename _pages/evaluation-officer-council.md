          <li>papers and tools addressing methodological issues that affect Federal program evaluation; and</li>
          <li>professional development opportunities for the Federal evaluation community.</li> 
          </ul>
          <p>ICEP membership is limited to Federal staff who are technical experts in one or more aspects of evaluation, and serve time-limited terms. ICEP is led by a steering committee.</p>
