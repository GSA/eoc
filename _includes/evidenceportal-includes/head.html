    content="Federal agencies are committed to building the evidence needed to inform decision making and improve policy and programmatic functions, and are interested in engaging with external researchers outside the government to address timely and policy-relevant questions. Through their Learning Agendas, agencies articulate priority questions and initial plans toward building that evidence. However, agencies cannot do this work alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about the open projects below. The Evidence Project Portal shares opportunities for researchers to engage with federal agencies on their evidence-building needs, and for researchers to express interest in supporting the opportunities described. This portal aims to foster the connections needed to develop, launch, and enhance cross-sector relationships to advance these evidence-building activities. Have questions about the Portal?
