        - ICEP is co-chaired by an Agency representative, on a rotating basis, and a representative from the OMB Evidence Team. The co-chairs, along with the Steering Committee, establish priorities, communicate with the Evaluation Officer Council, and provide guidance to the ICEP sub-committees. Steering Committee members are also active participants in the work of the Council.

        - ICEP members are current Federal employees who are technical experts in one or more aspects of evaluation. Members serve in their personal capacities as experts and do not represent their agencies. ICEP membership, including the Steering Committee, includes evaluators across all agency types (CFO Act, Small, and Independent) and sizes (large, midsize, and small), serving in a variety of roles including supervisory or non-supervisory, at different levels of their organization, (e.g., headquarters and components). There is no requirement that each agency be represented on ICEP at any given time nor is there a prohibition against multiple participants from a single agency. In sum, the critical element of membership is the evaluation expertise the individual brings in support of advancing the Federal evaluation community.
        - All members commit to a minimum 14-month, renewable term. Members carry out the work of the ICEP through their contributions to specific subcommittees, projects, or activities based on their interests and expertise.
