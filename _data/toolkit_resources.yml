  title: Introduction to Randomized Evaluations
  description: Randomized evaluations, also known as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), are one of the most rigorous evaluation methods used to conduct impact evaluations to determine the extent to which your program, policy, or initiative caused the outcomes you see. They use random assignment of people/organizations/communities affected by the program or policy to rule out other factors that might have caused the changes your program or policy was designed to achieve. This in-depth resource introduces randomized evaluations in a non-technical way, provides examples of RCTs in practice, describes when RCTs might be the right approach, and offers a thorough FAQ about RCTs.

    You may find yourself needing to make the case for evaluation to others in your agency. These PowerPoint "pitch decks" bring together several resources you can use and tailor to your own needs and agency context. Knowing that your audience(s) may vary, there are three different pitch decks that vary in length and level of detail: (1) <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/Resource_Evidence for Action - 5 minutes.pptx">5-Minute Quick Pitch</a>; (2) <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/Resource_Evidence for Action - 10 minutes.pptx">10-Minute Presentation</a>; and (3) <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/Resource_Evidence for Action - 20 minutes.pptx">20-Minute Discussion</a>. Each slide deck speaks to the value of evaluation and explains how it can improve decision-making. Check out the cover sheet to learn more about each deck and see which one may be most helpful for you.
