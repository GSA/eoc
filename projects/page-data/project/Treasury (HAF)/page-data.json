the Office of Management and Budget hosted a researcher interest meeting on February, 13, 2024.

HAF provides $9.961 billion for states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, Tribes or Tribal entities, and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to provide relief for the country’s most vulnerable homeowners. In the immediate term, a key research priority for the Homeowner Assistance Fund is understanding how its funds are flowing to homeowners most in need of assistance. </p><p >In comparison to previous programs to assist homeowners, such as those launched during the Great Recession, HAF is uniquely <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ADVANCING-EQUITY-THROUGH-THE-AMERICAN-RESCUE-PLAN.pdf\">focused on equity</a> and meeting the needs of low-income homeowners. Specifically, HAF recipients must use at least 60 percent of their HAF award funds for qualified expenses to assist homeowners with incomes at or below 100 percent of Area Median Income (AMI) or less than 100% of the median income for the U.S. Additionally, any amount not made available to homeowners that meet the income-targeting requirement must be prioritized for assistance to “socially disadvantaged individuals.” Taken together with <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/HAF-Guidance.pdf\">program features</a> that permit payments for a wide range of expenses (including utilities and homeowners association fees), allow for a variety of support for homeowners (legal services and housing counseling), and <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/homeowner-assistance-fund/promising-practices\">encourage</a> culturally competent outreach strategies, this focus on assisting the most in need homeowners makes addressing barriers to equitable access a key consideration in the program’s implementation. </p>"},{"fieldTitle":"Deliverables","fieldData":"<ul >\n<li><strong>Meetings:</strong> Regular meetings with Treasury program and evaluation staff to discuss the research approach, the evaluation plan, initial findings, and reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluation Plan:</strong> An evaluation plan that Treasury will review before researchers begin any analysis.

To identify potential evaluation designs, researchers could also use information on the differing features of each state’s HAF program by examining the state plans <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/homeowner-assistance-fund/plans\">posted on Treasury’s website</a>. </p><p >To dive more deeply into how the program is <a href=\"https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/homeowner-assistance-fund-county-level-targeting-data\">serving</a> low-income and socially disadvantaged homeowners, researchers could partner with a <a href=\"https://www.ncsha.org/homeowner-assistance-fund/\">state</a> to use data on the <a href=\"https://www.chfa.org/myhomect-summary-dashboard/\">distribution</a> of HAF assistance across census tracts to perform a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of areas that had larger numbers of HAF beneficiaries, with a particular focus on examining Qualified Census Tracts. In addition, Treasury could help researchers work with states to confidentially access individual level beneficiary data via a secure data sharing agreement. </p><p >Additional potential data sources could include <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/2021/ahs-2021-public-use-file--puf-/ahs-2021-national-public-use-file--puf-.html\">foreclosure data</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc/background.html\">credit reporting information</a> which <br />can be used to do more in depth examination of the equity impact of the program with the possibility to examine which aspects of the program were most successful for increasing assistance to underserved homeowners.</p>"},{"fieldTitle":"Other Benefits to Project Partners","fieldData":"<p >Treasury could provide briefings to researchers about the HAF program, including information on program structure, the state plan approval process, available data, and program chronology.
