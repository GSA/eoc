href=\"https://www.performance.gov/pma/\">President’s Management Agenda</a> Priority 2 envisions the delivery of excellent, equitable, and secure services and customer experiences to the American people by and across Federal Government. Yet, Federal services have not always been designed with the public’s needs and priorities in mind, nor have these services always kept up with these needs.  Achieving PMA goals require a renewed emphasis on direct engagement with Americans of all walks of life to reimagine the delivery of Federal services. The American people deserve a government that understands who they are, what they need, and how best to deliver for them.  <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/participation/\">Federal agencies are embracing the importance of PPCE</a> and trying new and innovative ways to extend engagement opportunities to the public and especially members of communities who historically have been excluded or whose views may not be well represented through traditional public comment processes. </p>\n<p>Given the limitations of public input garnered through traditional PPCE activities, including <u>Federal Register</u> notice and comment processes and Requests for Information, in representing the full breadth of American experiences, agencies are pursuing other approaches, including consultations, listening sessions, customer feedback surveys, user research, and crowdsourcing. More equitable and effective public engagement benefits Federal agencies by improving their awareness of and responsiveness to the perspectives and needs of the communities and individuals affected by their policies and programs. Individuals and communities can benefit by gaining more awareness and understanding of government policies and programs that impact them and sharing their experiences and expertise to influence changes that improve their interactions with and trust in government.</p>\n<p>To help agencies develop effective approaches for meaningfully engaging with the public, OMB has recently published a <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/20/2024-05882/methods-and-leading-practices-for-advancing-public-participation-and-community-engagement-with-the\">Request for Information in the Federal Register</a> seeking the public’s input on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experiences individuals and organizations have had in participating (or trying to participate) in Federal Government PPCE activities</li>\n<li>Content to incorporate in a Federal framework for PPCE, including common guidelines and leading practices that can help Federal employees better use these methods; and</li>\n<li>Suggestions for how OMB might continue to pursue a collaborative process to co-develop such a framework with the public.</li>\n<li>A critical complement to improving how Federal agencies conduct PPCE activities is the development of methods to evaluate the extent to which the efforts they adopt and implement are effective. Also, as agencies pilot, implement, or experiment with approaches to their PPCE activities, they need support in measuring and evaluating whether and how those changes are an improvement relative to the status quo. Currently, Federal agencies do not have a shared set of valid quantitative or qualitative metrics or well-developed evaluation plans that would enable them to rigorously measure the effectiveness of different approaches to PPCE. </li>\n</ul>"},{"fieldTitle":"Deliverables","fieldData":"<p>The Challenge Solver will provide a scalable, cost-effective PPCE Evaluation Toolkit that can be used by Federal agencies to evaluate their PPCE activities. The toolkit should include (but need not be limited to) guidance for evaluation planning (e.g., actionable and practicable approaches for embedding evaluation in PPCE approaches and the roll-out of new methods, including related communications and outreach); identification of valid output and outcome measures (relevant indicators may include measures of participant diversity, breadth and saturation of reach, new or unique perspectives gained by Federal officials, engagement quality, engagement satisfaction, and measures of trust in government); and strategies to collect and analyze that data to contribute to a shared and growing evidence base that can inform continual improvement and refinement of approaches to effective and equitable PPCE across the government.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Phase I – Technical Concept Paper</em></strong><em><br /></em>In Phase I, all interested potential solvers will submit a technical concept paper that details their approach to developing the PPCE evaluation toolkit. The concept paper should outline potential output and outcome measures and how they will be validated, the types and sources of data agencies could use to evaluate their PPCE activities, other components that the toolkit will include, and how the toolkit will be designed and developed (including file formats, software, or platforms) to aid Federal agencies in the evaluation of their PPCE activities. Solvers may look to existing literature, scholarly articles, research, and other resources as they identify recommended evaluation methods.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Phase II – Evaluation Toolkit and Use Case</em></strong><em><br /></em>In Phase II, the winning solvers from Phase I will develop and submit their detailed PPCE evaluation toolkit for use by Federal agencies.

To help achieve these goals, Agency X wants to implement PPCE approaches that ensure the Agency is able to broadly share information with and get feedback from those individuals impacted by these programs, including underserved communities (see E.O. 13985 for definition intended). The agency also wants to ensure its participation processes are inclusive and accessible, and that its efforts build trust with participants. The agency plans to use this diverse feedback to identify and address challenges that the public may face in accessing or participating in these programs. Agency X has historically only used Requests for Information (RFI) as a PPCE method with citizens. Generally, RFI responses are primarily received from industry associations. Agency X officials feel that this approach will be insufficient for garnering broad and diverse engagement in the development of its new environmental justice initiative it is planning. Agency X wants to implement PPCE approaches that will ensure it reaches broad audiences as intended, hears from many and diverse perspectives, and is accessible and inclusive in its efforts to engage with the public.  </em></p>\n<p><em>Describe in a Use Case how Agency X can use the Evaluation Toolkit to aid it with the following questions:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>What should Agency X consider when deciding what PPCE approaches, including methods of engagement, to implement? </em></li>\n<li><em>What does Agency X need to do as part of the implementation planning and roll-out to support evaluation of their chosen PPCE activity?</em></li>\n<li><em>What should Agency X measure and how?</em></li>\n<li><em>Overall, how would your toolkit be responsive to Agency X’s need as described in the case study?</em></li>\n</ul>"},{"fieldTitle":"Planned use of results","fieldData":"<p>The Challenge will result in an evaluation toolkit that Federal agencies can use to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of their PPCE approaches.  The toolkit will provide ways to better evaluate PPCE activities and approaches, so that agencies will have better information to inform the selection and implementation of more effective PPCE approaches that will help agencies advance the PMA priorities.</p>"},{"fieldTitle":"Data","fieldData":"<p>No data will be provided for this Challenge.</p>"},{"fieldTitle":"Agency Learning Agenda Question(s)","fieldData":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.performance.gov/PMA/PMA-Learning-Agenda.pdf\">President’s Management Agenda Learning Agenda</a><u>:</u> What are effective approaches that agencies can take in managing the business of Government to address barriers that have hindered equal opportunity?</p>"}],"openText":null,"mainContact":{"name":"Paul Strande","title":"Senior Advisor for Research Partnerships ","employer":"Office of Management and Budget","email":"evidence@omb.eop.gov","image":null},"projectTeam":[{"name":"Test Partner 1","title":null,"employer":null,"email":null,"image":null},{"name":"Test Partner 2","title":null,"employer":null,"email":null,"image":null},{"name":"Test Partner 3","title":null,"employer":null,"email":null,"image":null},{"name":"Test Partner 4","title":null,"employer":null,"email":null,"image":null}],"faq":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"PMALA Challenge"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677476431"],"slicesMap":{}}
