This is the initial check in for the Evidence Portal code. GSA's instructions were to check in changes to the Projects/Feature folder, but doesn't
go into specifics. So I've created this readme to help decipher the changes and where they are supposed to go.

-config.yml
	-This is to add a menu item to the Explore menu
	
	
-evidence-portal
	-Please put this in the _pages folder. Doing this coupled with the changes to config.yml will have the code work
