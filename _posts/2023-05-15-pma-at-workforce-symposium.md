The Biden-Harris Administration's first ever President's Management Agenda (PMA) [Learning Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/pma/learning-agenda/){:target="_blank"} came to life on May 16<sup>th</sup> through a Workforce Symposium co-hosted by the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/){:target="_blank"}, the [Office of Personnel Management](https://www.opm.gov/){:target="_blank"} and the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/){:target="_blank"}. The event brought together the Federal evaluation community external researchers and academics, and Federal leaders from across the government to discuss the latest evidence on the Federal workforce.

Over 750 participants heard presentations from 37 speakers on

- *Recruiting the next generation of Federal Employees*,
- *Effective Strategies for Improving Organizational Health and Performance*,
- *Promoting Federal Employee Mental Health and Well-Being*, and
- *Maximizing Effective Hybrid Work Environments*.

In opening the event, **Loren DeJonge Schulman**, Associate Director for Performance and Personnel Management at OMB noted that the PMA Learning Agenda seeks both to encourage the building of evidence to inform better management practices, and to encourage the use of that evidence by Federal leaders. To do this successfully, Schulman focused on the incredibly important middle step of bringing together researchers and practitioners, saying: "We need researchers to synthesize existing evidence and translate it into actionable steps for practitioners; practitioners to make decisions based on that evidence; and both practitioners and researchers to identify evidence gaps to inform future evidence building efforts."

**David Padrino**, Chief Transformation Officer at OPM then highlighted how the PMA workforce priority teams are tackling important issues, through the launch of Government-wide working groups and communities of practice (CoP), such as the inter-agency Mental Health & Well-Being and Recruitment & Outreach CoPs. Padrino also noted that OPM's priority policy guidance to address central challenges identified by agencies, including internship guidance and an increase to the federal minimum wage.

During breakout sessions, attendees interacted with researchers and practitioners from across the government, including:

- **Arron Helm**, Chief Human Capital Officer, at the Environmental Protection Agency, who shared EPA's innovative strategies to attract the next generation of federal talent;
- **Lenora Stiles,** Director, Office of Strategic Planning and Performance Improvement, at the Treasury Department, who described how they integrate performance data into agency review processes;
- **Jeane Garcia-Davis**, Office of the Surgeon General, at the Department of Health and Human Services shared the recent Surgeon General's [Report on Workplace Well-being](https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/workplace-well-being/index.html), and
- **Ted Kaouk,** Deputy Director for Human Capital Data Management and Modernization (HCDMM), and Chief Data Officer at OPM shared OPM's new dashboards to help agencies better understand and analyze their data.

These sessions also featured external researchers and academics, including:

- **Dr. Sydney Heimbrock**, Chief Industry Officer, Qualtrics [provide summary...]
- **John Kamensky**, Emeritus Fellow, IBM Center for the Business of Government, who shared highlights from National Academy of Public Administration's 2018 report on "[Strengthening Organizational Health and Performance in Government](https:/napawash.org/academy-studies/strengthening-organizational-health-and-performance-in-government){:target="_blank"}"
- **Dr. Jessica Sowa,** Professor, Biden School of Public Policy, University of Delaware, who provided a broad overview of the latest academic research on workforce mental health and well-being.

**Erica Zielewski,** Senior Evidence Analyst on the Evidence Team at OMB, closed out the event by highlighting what is coming next from the PMA Learning Agenda.  Zielewski noted that the research, tools, and other insights from the PMA Learning Agenda Workforce Symposium would be compiled and shared via "PMA Learning Agenda State of the Evidence Summaries." This series of documents will highlight the latest findings and areas for future research related to the topics covered by the symposium.  They will be posted on [Evaluation.Gov]({{site.baseurl}}/) and distributed widely as a resource for Federal managers and leaders.

Zielewski also highlighted Evaluation.gov's [Learning Agenda Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/learning-agenda-questions-dashboard/), where researchers and academics can find agencies with common research interests to inform possible partnerships. She also previewed an upcoming Research Portal, which will provide a mechanism to facilitate connections between agencies and researchers interested in partnering together to build evidence on identified topics.

In closing, Zielewski emphasized, "strengthening the collaboration between Federal Agencies and academics will help us achieve the promise of the President's Management Agenda to strengthen and empower the Federal workforce to achieve an equitable, effective, and accountable Government that delivers results for all Americans."
