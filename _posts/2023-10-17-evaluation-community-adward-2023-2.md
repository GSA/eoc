On behalf of the Evaluation Officer Council, it is our honor to announce the winners of the Fourth Annual Evaluation Community Awards Program! Each year, we are overwhelmed with pride and admiration for the individuals and teams nominated and selected to receive these awards, and this year is no exception. To honor Federal civil service leaders working tirelessly to advance evaluation and evidence-based policymaking across the Federal Government, we solicited nominations from across the Federal evaluation community. We received over 30 fantastic nominations representing 20 different agencies or components, and OMB announced the selected awardees at the October Evaluation Officer Council meeting.

The 2024 Evaluation Community Awards recipients highlighted below provide a glimpse of the how the Federal evaluation community is working tirelessly to improve programs and operations across the Government. The profiles below share excerpts from the winning nominations to illustrate the myriad ways that Federal evaluators, and the high-quality evidence they generate, inform critical program and policy decisions and support positive change. We share these profiles to recognize the exemplary work of the awardees and inspire others to engage with and support the Federal evaluation community in all they do to improve Federal programs and decision-making!

       "Mr. Klimek is committed to breaking silos and inspiring a culture of evaluation across DOC. He has worked with internal agency colleagues to support the design of a fast-track clearance process to promote efficiency and innovative solutions across DOC grant programs. He has led a collaborative and working agreement with statistical agencies to link data and enhance cross-departmental evaluations at a global, state, and local level. This collaboration is critical for evidence-building that impacts the economic and social well-being of individuals, small businesses, and communities."
    <br><br>
       The working agreement across statistical agencies and bureaus allows a deeper dive into the data by giving Evaluation leads better access and data linkage abilities to determine programmatic and participant outcomes and impact needed to meet various agency's evidence building and evaluation goals and objectives. The goal is to develop tools and models to better guide federal investments.  Under his leadership, bureaus have come together to work toward a common goal and participates in a community of practice, monthly, to share and learn from each other, which also further inspires a culture of evidence building and evaluation. During these presentations, all of DOC Bureau Heads and other key staff members are invited to learn and participate.”

       “… Dr. Martin oversees a portfolio of program evaluations and other evidence-building initiatives that mirror Rural Development's (RD) wide-ranging mission. [Her] commitment to the standards of relevance and utility, independence and objectivity, and rigor is evident in her ongoing effort to build a valid and reliable body of program and socio-economic data to assess RD's impact on rural America. Making the data accessible to the public through a set of tools and resources demonstrates her commitment to transparency and ethics. The Rural Data Gateway, for example, includes investment data for more than 65 RD programs that can be viewed and downloaded by members of the public.
    <br><br>
       … Dr. Martin and her team conduct innovative, relevant, objective, and rigorous program evaluations.  As one example of this, they built a rural-centric Distressed Community Index to assess the extent to which RD investments result in community-wide improvements in living conditions, amenities, and services.  The analysis produced conclusive evidence that RD programs collectively improved rural communities' wellbeing. It found that a $10 million investment in a rural community can lift a community from a distressed to at-risk status. 
    <br><br>
       Dr. Martin has also been an influential leader at USDA. Her presentations on evaluation designs, methods, and results generate interest by others who want to apply RD's methods to evaluations of their programs.”

       “Tom Hertz developed a method to assess fairness with regard to race in pre-refund audits for taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) at the IRS.  This was a difficult project, with a high profile in the press and with external stakeholders, especially the Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity. 
    <br><br>
       Taxpayers do not report race when they file a 1040.  So, first, Tom participated in the development of a model to impute race data for tax filers, collaborating with a team of academics and the Treasury Department. He worked with program personnel to integrate a measure of compliance risk that allowed for a more nuanced bias assessment.  He also worked closely with leadership and Treasury policymakers to communicate findings and mitigation options.  The mitigations showed program administrators that it was possible to both decrease disparate impact and also increase revenue.  Through his efforts, the IRS has effective methods for evaluating disparate impacts that can be applied to other workstreams.  Tom is a persuasive advocate for this analysis and has worked long hours to bring it to fruition.”

Our learning agenda update is robust, dynamic, inclusive, and strongly linked to our outcome focused strategic plan.
