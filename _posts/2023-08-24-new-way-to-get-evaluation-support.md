High quality program evaluations require connecting agencies’ evidence questions with the expertise to answer them. That is the goal of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/Program Evaluation Services Subgroup One-Pager.pdf">new Program Evaluation Services subgroup</a> on the General Service Administration’s Multiple Award Schedule (MAS). The subgroup, which launched on July 20, 2023, under MAS Special Item Number (SIN) 541611, creates a group of qualified, pre-vetted contractors that can be selected by Federal agencies to design and carry out program evaluations. The subgroup helps agencies find qualified contractors for evaluations and related studies, which allows them to tap into the expertise they need for high-quality evaluations that meet Federal evidence-building needs.

It's easy for qualified evaluation contractors to join the new subgroup! Contractors, including large firms and small businesses, can apply to join the subgroup by following <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/Professional Services_Category_Attachment_Sol_47QSMD20R0001_Amd_17.pdf">these instructions</a>. Applications are reviewed by a panel of Federal evaluation experts, and those contractors with documented expertise and experience in program evaluation are invited to join the subgroup (no contract modification required). Later this fall, Federal agencies will be able to channel their program evaluation requests for proposals (RFPs) directly to this subgroup. This ensures that the applications agencies receive, and the contracts that result, will be limited to qualified subgroup holders. 

Using the Program Evaluation Services subgroup is a win-win for everyone. Agencies can target solicitations for evaluations and evaluation-related projects to contractors with verified expertise in program evaluation, and contractors in the subgroup can more easily learn about the large and growing Federal investment in program evaluation. There are other benefits too: Federal procurement staff will contribute to their agency’s <a href="https://gsa.federalschedules.com/resources/your-guide-to-category-management/" target="_blank">Spend Under Management goals</a> by making awards through the subgroup, and members of the subgroup will have the opportunity to meet regularly with Federal teams to discuss leading practices in program evaluation procurement. The first meeting is being planned for November 2023 and will be open to all vendors who have been approved to join the subgroup by that date.

This innovation is the result of a multi-year effort to address long-standing challenges that agencies face in identifying and connecting with highly skilled contractors to meet critical evaluation needs. The Program Evaluation Services subgroup is just one way that the Office of Management and Budget Evidence Team and the General Services Administration are working together to strengthen federal infrastructure for high-quality program evaluation.
