The [Evidence chapter](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ap_12_evidence_fy2024.pdf){:target="_blank"} in the President’s Budget and the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/2024 Evidence Chapter in Brief.pdf">Chapter in Brief</a> highlight the Administration’s accomplishments and continued commitment to building and using evidence. The President’s Budget for fiscal year 2024 demonstrates the Administration’s commitment to evidence and evaluation priorities with new and sustained investments necessary for agencies to establish and staff the evaluation function, plan and execute evidence-building activities that employ high-quality evaluation methods, and deliver on evidence-based policymaking. The Budget makes targeted investments to support these activities and for agencies to build in evaluation planning and execution from the start as they implement new and existing programs, policies, and operations.
