The OMB Evidence Team is excited to launch the new [Evidence Project Portal](https://www.evaluation.gov/evidenceportal/) on Evaluation.gov! Over the last year, OMB has worked with agencies to pilot the Evidence Project Portal process for identifying and sharing agency projects with the public and broader research community to facilitate collaborations that can help build evidence. The new Evidence Project Portal website enhances that process with a user-friendly web interface that improves the visibility of Open, In-Progress, and Completed Projects, and provides expanded capabilities to search and filter projects by agency, date, or topic. This new Portal site aims to improve connections between agencies with identified evidence needs and the public, especially those looking to conduct policy-relevant research.

For agencies, the Portal offers a way to connect with those outside the government who bring skills and expertise to contribute to critical efforts, including analyses of public or restricted use data, literature reviews or meta-analyses, evaluation design, or offering new insights on a thorny evidence gap. The Portal can reduce the barriers those outside the Federal government face to understanding what evidence Federal agencies need, and to connecting with agency staff who can apply the evidence and insights that those outside of government produce. The Portal is modeled on the highly successful [North Carolina Project Portal](https://projectportal.nc.gov/), which has demonstrated the value of this approach to sharing the evidence needs of government and making it easier for the public to express interest in collaborating to support the work.
