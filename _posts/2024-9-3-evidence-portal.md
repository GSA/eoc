The OMB Evidence Team is excited to launch the new [Evidence Project Portal]({{site.baseurl}}/evidenceportal/) on Evaluation.gov. Over the last year, OMB has worked with agencies to pilot the Evidence Project Portal process for identifying and sharing agency projects with the broader research community to facilitate partnerships that can help build evidence. The new Evidence Project Portal website enhances that process with a user-friendly web interface that improves the visibility of the Open, In-Progress, and Completed Projects, and provides expanded capabilities to search and filter projects by agency, date, or topic. This new Portal site aims to improve connections between agencies looking to share their evidence project needs with the external community and researchers looking to conduct policy-relevant research.

For agencies, the Portal offers a way to connect with external researchers and draw on the full range of expertise for help with analyses on public or restricted use data, literature reviews or meta-analyses, evaluation design, or gaining new insights on a thorny evidence gap. The Portal can reduce the barriers that researchers outside the Federal government face to understanding what evidence Federal agencies need, and to connecting with agency staff who can apply the evidence and insights that external researchers produce. The Portal is modeled on the highly successful [North Carolina Project Portal](https://projectportal.nc.gov/){:target="_blank"}, which has demonstrated the value of this approach to sharing the research needs of government and empowering researchers with a way to express interest in partnering to support the work.
