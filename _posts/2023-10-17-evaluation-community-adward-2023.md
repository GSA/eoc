Once again, we are thrilled to share the winners of the Annual Evaluation Community Awards Program, on behalf of the Evaluation Officer Council! These awards celebrate Federal civil service leaders committed to uplifting evaluation and evidence-based policymaking across the Federal Government whose work far too often goes unrecognized. Individuals from across the Federal evaluation community, as well as those who work alongside Federal evaluators, nominated 26 individuals and team, representing 15 different agencies. A cross-functional panel reviewed the submissions to provide recommendations for recipients in each category. OMB presented the awards at the October 2023 Evaluation Officer Council (EOC) meeting.

The winners of the 2023 Evaluation Community Awards profiled below reflect the commitment and ingenuity of the Federal evaluation community. The below excerpts from their nominations share compelling stories of how Federal evaluators develop high-quality evidence that program and policy leaders rely on, contributing to positive change across Government. The profiles of each recipient serve to showcase their excellent work, which we hope inspires others to connect with and celebrate the Federal evaluation community in all they do to improve Federal programs and enable evidence-based policymaking and decision-making!

       "The HHS COVID-19 Public Education Campaign is a national initiative to increase public confidence in and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and educate the public about the availability of COVID treatments while reinforcing basic prevention measures. The Campaign is led by a team of government employees on detail to HHS, including those who specialize in research and evaluation as well as those in other disciplines who led efforts on partnerships, media placement, and strategic planning. 
       <br><br>
       As one of the largest public education campaigns in U.S. history, evaluation was critical to demonstrating Campaign success and securing funding. The campaign relied on a multi-method approach to evaluate campaign effectiveness, including using social media analysis, in-depth interviews, focus groups, and longitudinal and cross-sectional nationally representative surveys.  This methodology reflects a novel way to simultaneously evaluate short- and long-term campaign effectiveness.
       <br><br>
       As COVID-19 was an evolving pandemic, the team demonstrated agility and efficiency to quickly analyze data and tailor messaging. The evaluation findings show that the Campaign helped the public make informed decisions about their health and COVID-19. Specifically, exposure to the campaign increased vaccine confidence and likelihood of first-dose vaccination."

        <p>Enoh T. Ebong is the Director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. Nominated by President Biden to serve as USTDA’s Director, she was confirmed by unanimous consent of the U.S. Senate.

            <li>Insistence on using evidence from past climate obligations to improve a strategic objective goal in the 4-Year Strategic Plan.</li>

            <li>Use of multiple evaluation findings relating to stakeholder responsiveness and resulting impacts to USTDA’s ability to understand and document outcomes. Director Ebong uses those findings to discuss with stakeholders’ senior leadership the importance of providing information during the evaluation process.  Director Ebong’s approach to always include Monitoring & Evaluation representatives in the room during these discussions helps to underscore the importance to USTDA of monitoring, evaluation, and evidence-based learning."</li>

        <p>Marsha leads the evaluation division at the U.S. Department of Education, working with a talented team of researchers and analysts to design and conduct rigorous studies of federal programs and federally supported strategies.  Drawing on nearly three decades of experience, she has helped the Department develop its evidence agenda, supporting program offices and grantees in both using and generating evaluations to improve program outcomes.</p>

<blockquote class="padding-bottom-2">

       "Marsha truly exemplifies each of values found in the Department’s evaluation policy, modeling rigor, utility, objectivity, transparency, and ethics. Her tireless work across the Department garnered senior leader (Assistant Secretary-level) buy-in to design and conduct the Department’s first-ever randomized controlled trial of a federal student aid program, rigorously evaluating the impact of access to Pell Grant funds for short-term programs. The resulting study yielded evidence crucial to Executive and Legislative branch policymakers.
       <br><br>
       Marsha’s fair, open, and forthright style has allowed her to build productive working relationships with stakeholders both within and beyond ED, including staunch advocates who were wary of rigorous program evaluation. Several evaluations, both recently completed and underway, would not have been possible without her collegial spirit and commitment to learning for the sake of program improvement, including impact studies of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. As she nears her 25th year with the Department, Marsha has been a role model for a generation of program evaluators known government-wide for their commitment to excellence.”

       “Paul O’Leary, a Senior Economist at the SSA, has led the development of an innovative evaluation infrastructure that includes the creation of the Disability Analysis Files (DAF) and National Beneficiary Surveys. As part of his work leading the agency’s Ticket to Work (TTW) evaluation, Paul had the foresight to identify the need for these data for broader evidence-building and evaluation.  … These files serve as a key source of information on program experiences and return-to-work outcomes for SSA disability beneficiaries. The data files have been used to conduct evaluations to support major regulatory changes to the Ticket to Work program, as well as by the Department of Education, GAO, and numerous external researchers.
       <br><br>
       In addition to developing the data and mentoring junior members of SSA’s evaluation team, Paul’s own evaluations using these data have set the standard by which the TTW program has been assessed. His rigorous analytical approach to the TTW evaluation has often corrected the naive analyses from external stakeholders that created misperceptions about the program. Paul’s work is foundational to the agency’s efforts to fulfill the promise of the Evidence Act.”

        <p>Maureen leads a multidisciplinary team in building evaluation capacity within the National Asthma Control Program and its partners.

She mentors the multitudes: her team members, who never really leave Maureen’s team even when they’ve moved on; solo evaluators in her center and beyond who need a thought partner (or therapist); evaluation fellows whose supervisors aren’t grounded in the Framework; and staff in funded state programs, whether they’re the epidemiologist-turned-evaluator (yesterday) or the evaluator with decades of experience.
       <br><br>
       Maureen truly practices what she preaches; she brings a practical approach to evaluation, emphasizing utility and promoting efficient and effective use of evaluation resources (and by extension, programmatic resources). Maureen’s research on evaluative thinking illustrates her awareness that we make great progress by helping colleagues create space to reflect on their work, project its impact, bring multiple perspectives to their work (even dissenting ones), and draw on evidence in decision making. Many, many of us have learned this from Maureen. Her influence is deep, wide, and will persist long past her 2024 retirement.”
