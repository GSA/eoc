Today, the Biden-Harris Administration launched a &quot;Year of Evidence for Action&quot; at its first-ever White House Summit on Evidence for Action, co-hosted by the [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp) (OSTP) and the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb) (OMB).

During this Year of Evidence, the Administration will:

- Share leading practices from Federal agencies to generate and use research-backed knowledge to advance better, more equitable outcomes for all of America;
- Strengthen and develop new strategies and structures to institutionalize evidence-based decision-making in the Federal government; and
- Increase connection and collaboration between researchers, knowledge producers and decision makers inside and outside of the Federal Government.

Motivated by the [Memorandum on Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/memorandum-on-restoring-trust-in-government-through-scientific-integrity-and-evidence-based-policymaking/) the bipartisan [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174), and related [Guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/M-21-27.pdf) issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Federal agencies have embarked on ambitious planning processes, including the creation of [Annual Evaluation Plans](https://www.evaluation.gov/evidence-plans/annual-evaluation-plan/), [Learning Agendas](https://www.evaluation.gov/evidence-plans/learning-agenda/), and [Evaluation Policies](https://www.evaluation.gov/evidence-plans/evaluation-policies/). Federal agencies also have appointed [Evaluation Officers](https://www.evaluation.gov/evaluation-officer-council/#members), [Chief Data Officers](https://www.cdo.gov/), and Statistical Officials to lead this work, further building the internal capacity for evidence-based policy and practice.

These efforts have already led to real impacts within the Federal Government and for the American people. As many examples of evidence-based practice and policy pursued by Federal agencies show: people benefit when evidence informs U.S. Government decisions. Those marginalized in the housing market gain access to fairer, better housing options. People struggling in the wake of COVID-19 are able to enter effective programs like Registered Apprenticeships, which pave the way to fulfilling, high-paying jobs. And students have better academic outcomes when schools embrace evidence-based strategies for teaching and supporting their needs, no matter where they live, creating better, more equitable futures.

Through the Year of Evidence for Action, we will continue the effort to build, nurture, and expand a culture of evidence across the Federal government. Many of these activities are well underway; you can learn more about them by reading Federal agencies&#39; Learning Agendas.

In the Executive Office of the President, we also have a variety of new efforts underway.

Here are just a few examples:

- **Connecting the Research Community to Evidence Priorities inside the Federal Government through a Novel Funding Pilot** : The **Analytics for Equity Pilot** , a first-of-its-kind initiative led by NSF, OSTP, and OMB, will leverage NSF&#39;s experience in funding research grants and connecting with academics. To do so, it will distribute targeted funding to external research teams that submit rigorous proposals to directly address Federal agencies&#39; priority learning questions that focus on equity. The Pilot aims to include participation from academics with a broad range of institutional affiliations and areas of expertise. Agency partners will help shape the Pilot&#39;s focus on key thematic areas and will provide guidance on data resources and agency needs. In addition to NSF, agency partners for this Pilot include the [Department of Health and Human Services&#39;](https://www.hhs.gov/) (HHS) [Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation](https://aspe.hhs.gov/) and [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC), the [Department of Labor&#39;s (DOL) Chief Evaluation Office](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasp/evaluation), and the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/). For more information, including details on the forthcoming Call for Proposals and relevant deadlines, by emailing NSF&#39;s [Evaluation and Assessment Capability Office](https://nsf.gov/od/oia/eac/) at eac.nsf.gov.
- **Building Skills and Knowledge within the Federal Evidence Community** : The OMB Evidence Team is partnering with HHS and agency evaluation experts to develop the **Federal Evaluation Toolkit**. This resource will help build evaluation skills among the Federal workforce broadly by addressing the value of evaluation, how to interpret and communicate results to Agency leaders, and how leaders can – and should – use results to support decision-making.
- **Mobilizing Social and Behavioral Research Evidence to Inform Policy:** The OSTP-led [**National Science and Technology Council**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/nstc/) will re-charter the **Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS) Subcommittee** of the Committee on Science. This Subcommittee was decommissioned in the previous Administration, and now will be reconstituted with the directive to carry out short-term, high-priority tasks regarding the use of social and behavioral science evidence in Federal practices and policies, and then will lay the groundwork for longer-term coordination of agency efforts related to these topics. The first short-term task will be to deliver whole-of-government Blueprint for the use of social and behavioral science research to advance evidence-based policymaking, due by April 30, 2023, per the SBS Subcommittee Charter.

The Biden-Harris Administration&#39;s commitment to making evidence-based decisions rooted in the best available science and data builds on two, central priorities: upholding [scientific integrity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/01-22-Protecting_the_Integrity_of_Government_Science.pdf) and advancing [equity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/). Both of these priorities require that we prioritize diversity, inclusion, and strong relationships – between scientists, practitioners, and the public – built on trust. Doing so will allow us to put knowledge to work to keep America safe, healthy, informed, and economically fulfilled.

But we cannot do this work alone.

An essential goal of the Year of Evidence is to build closer connections between diverse knowledge producers and decision makers inside and outside of the Federal Government.

As one important step, the Administration will co-host a series of events over the course of the Year of Evidence with leading non-profits and academic organizations to co-develop concrete strategies for mobilizing research-based evidence that can make life healthier, safer, more equitable, and more prosperous for the American public. These organizations have demonstrated expertise in translating research evidence to practice and policy, and include: the [Data Foundation](https://www.datafoundation.org/); the [Evidence-to-Impact Collaborative at the Pennsylvania State University](https://evidence2impact.psu.edu/);the [Institute for Research on Race and Public Policy at the University of Illinois-Chicago](https://irrpp.uic.edu/) and the [Center for Tax and Budget Accountability](https://www.ctbaonline.org/); [Pew Charitable Trusts](https://www.pewtrusts.org/); the [Policy Lab at Brown University](https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/); [Results for America](https://results4america.org/); and the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/).

We plan to keep the public updated and to share more examples of how evidence is being used meaningfully, government-wide, throughout the Year of Evidence. But we are also eager to learn from you! We encourage you to participate in the YEA in these five, practical ways:

1. Pursue policy-relevant research related to Administration and Agency priorities, which can be found in [President Biden&#39;s letter](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/a-letter-to-dr-eric-s-lander-the-presidents-science-advisor-and-nominee-as-director-of-the-office-of-science-and-technology-policy/) to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), or in [Federal agencies&#39; Learning Agendas](https://www.evaluation.gov/evidence-plans/learning-agenda/) and [Annual Evaluation Plans](https://www.evaluation.gov/evidence-plans/annual-evaluation-plan/), or to cross-cutting Administration priorities such as those found in the [draft President&#39;s Management Agenda Learning Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/pma/learning-agenda/).

2. Apply for contracts and grants that focus directly on evidence-building in support of the Federal Government, such as the new Analytics for Equity Initiative described above, co-developed by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) (NSF), the [Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/) (OSTP), and the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) (OMB).

3. Join the evidence infrastructure of the Federal Government by [pursuing employment in Federal agencies](https://www.usajobs.gov/) as program evaluators, data scientists, or science and technology policy analysts.

4. Consider taking a tour in public service through an [Intergovernmental Personnel Act](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/) (IPA) assignment, which allows for short-term engagements on behalf of the Federal government. Some examples of an IPA assignment include Fellowships with the [Office of Evaluation Services (OES) in the General Services Administration](https://oes.gsa.gov/opps/) (GSA), the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/apply), or policy offices in the [Executive Office of the President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/executive-office-of-the-president/), among other opportunities.

5. Help the Federal Government to build capacity by sending ideas, resources, guides, and other materials on evidence creation and use directly to [evidence@omb.eop.gov.](mailto:evidence@omb.eop.gov)
